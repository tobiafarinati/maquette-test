2026;FEB;SAT 21;ON;PATRICK NEDEL – LIRA TRANSALPINA;From Intention to Infrastructure: Workflow for Live Arts Event Production;14:30 / 17:30;This session facilitates a shared working space around the production of live arts events, starting from project intention and the organisational choices that often remain implicit. Through collective exercises, participants explore workflows, roles and decision-making processes, making responsibilities and sustainability visible.;SAT 28;ON;FRANCESCA MACIOCIA;Governance: Participation and Decision-Making Tools in Collective Processes;14:30 / 17:30;This session offers a critical investigation of governance practices in cultural contexts, focusing on how decisions are made and how power and responsibility are distributed. Starting from what truly matters for a collective — desire, meaning and shared work — the meeting introduces active governance tools that can support fairer, situated and long-lasting collective processes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;MAR;SAT 07;ON;TBA;Practices of Traversability: Towards Anti-Ableist Live Arts Design;14:30 / 17:30;The session activates a critical inquiry into accessibility practices in festivals and live arts events, highlighting ableist structures within the contemporary cultural system. Starting from the assumption that fully non-ableist spaces do not yet exist, the meeting explores how to work towards less exclusionary and more conscious practices. Through listening and co-creation, it introduces traversability as a relational and situated process, capable of transforming norms and modes of participation.;MON 09;ON;BERTRAM NIESSEN – CHE FARE;Strategic Planning and Transformative Methodologies for Cultural Associations / Part 1;18:30 / 20:00;At the centre of this meeting is the construction of strategic visions within cultural associations, understood as a collective and situated process. Through the analysis of real contexts and practical exercises, the session explores how a strategic planning can guide project, organisational and economic choices over time, connecting political desire, constraints, resources and sustainability.;WED 11;ON;BERTRAM NIESSEN – CHE FARE;Strategic Planning and Transformative Methodologies for Cultural Associations / Part 2;18:30 / 20:00;At the centre of this meeting is the construction of strategic visions within cultural associations, understood as a collective and situated process. Through the analysis of real contexts and practical exercises, the session explores how a strategic planning can guide project, organisational and economic choices over time, connecting political desire, constraints, resources and sustainability.;SAT 21;ON;ELISABETTA MAGISTRI, KRISTIANA MILE – SOTTERRANEA;Performing Arts: How Festivals and Performance Have Traversed the Last Twenty Years;14:30 / 17:30;Between the 1990s and the early 2000s, festivals and performance emerged as practices of withdrawal from institutional and market logic. Over time, however, this impulse did not remain outside the system: festivals became cultural brands, performance entered museums and international circuits, and the ephemeral was archived and funded, producing new economies and new game rules. The session offers critical tools to read these ambivalences and to question one’s own positioning within contemporary cultural production.;SAT 28;ON;ANDREA BAREGGI – LIRA TRANSALPINA;European Project Design: Navigating Grants, Vision and Resources;14:30 / 17:30;Reading a European funding grant also means taking a position in relation to a project’s vision, resources and sustainability. This session offers a critical introduction to European project design, focusing on the preliminary phase of program selection. Through concrete cases and criteria of project coherence, the meeting explores the relationship between objectives and funding opportunities, avoiding forced adaptations. The aim is to develop conscious choices regarding alliances, constraints and organisational implications.;;;;;;
;APR;SAT 11;ON;PAOLO FURIA, ROBIDA;Return and Cultural Resistance: Depopulation, Abandonment and Regeneration in Inner Areas;14:30 / 17:30;This meeting is dedicated to cultural practices in inner areas as spaces of desire, return and political tension. Through a dialogue between concrete experiences and theoretical horizons, the session explores how to inhabit marginal territories beyond the rhetorics of regeneration. The aim is to formulate practices grounded in listening and participation with rooted presences, connecting local knowledge and new forms of cultural project design, in order to imagine alternative models to institutional processes of territorial development.;SAT 18;OFF;AGATA DENNI, ALESSANDRO D’AVELLA – ECOLOGIA SOCIALE SOTTERRANEA, ABITANTI DELL’ALTA VALLE CERVO;Practices of Belonging in Response to Depopulation, Extractivism and Touristification in Inner Areas;09:00 / 13:00;A walk through the village of Piedicavallo as a practice of listening and cultural project design. By entering into relation with the people who inhabit it, the walk gathers memories, gestures and forms of commoning that continue to inform the present. Interweaving local knowledge and cultural experimentation, the meeting explores how these forms of knowledge can orient conscious processes, capable of escaping the extractive logics of touristification and the quantitative parameters that often govern project evaluation.;SAT 18;OFF;AGATA DENNI, ALESSANDRO D’AVELLA – ECOLOGIA SOCIALE SOTTERRANEA, ABITANTI DELL’ALTA VALLE CERVO, DAVIDE ROBALDO;Memory and Experimentation: Play as a Situated Relational Practice;15:30 / 18:30;This session is conceived as a moment of sharing and learning dedicated to play as a creative relational dynamic, capable of being reinvented, shared and “hacked” over time. Starting from the practice of the card game Tarocchi of Valle Cervo, the meeting explores how a traditional ludic device can remain alive today, generating forms of sociality, transmission and collective imagination. Alternating direct experience and discussion, play is proposed as a situated cultural methodology, capable of producing continuity and new possibilities through common gestures and rules.;SUN 19;OFF;LUCA CALZATI – SOTTERRANEA, MATTEO NEGRO;Getting to know the Territory We Act Within: Practices of Ecological Observation;09:00 / 13:00;This training experience moves through the territory of Piedicavallo as a practice of situated ecological observation. Through a guided lab-excursion, the meeting alternates scientific dissemination and direct listening to ecosystems, introducing biomonitoring tools such as the observation of stream macroinvertebrates, lichens and other bioindicators. The session invites participants to recognise the territory as a living and dynamic system, and also experiments with shared documentation through citizen science practices and digital tools, supporting research and environmental education.;;;;;;;;;;;;
;MAY;SAT 02;ON;SARA BEOMONTE ZOBEL, ELEONORA AMBROSINI – CACTUS PSICOLOGIA;Energy and Care in Festivals: Practices and Communication for Sustainable Work;14:30 / 17:30;This session is dedicated to the psychological sustainability of work within festivals and intensive production contexts. Through self-reflection and exchange on artistic and professional paths, the training proposes practices for managing body, mind and energy, while critically addressing models of self-exploitation in the sector. The aim is to experiment with strategies of mutual care and effective communication to navigate moments of stress, prevent burnout and sustain more livable working rhythms.;SAT 09;OFF;OFFICINA MARGHERA;DIY Design of Site-Responsive Installations;09:00 / 13:00;A meeting dedicated to installations as relational devices, capable of shaping ways of being together and inhabiting a space during an event. Starting from the mountain context of Piedicavallo, the session explores site-responsive designs that dialogue with materials, morphologies and territorial presences. Interweaving co-design, participatory design and curatorial research, the meeting offers practical tools and technical foundations to imagine modular and DIY structures, accompanying participants in developing a concrete plan over time.;SUN 10;OFF;EDOARDO FUMAGALLI, ELISABETTA MAGISTRI – SOTTERRANEA;Movement as a Relational Medium;09:00 / 13:00;Since its origins, dance has not only been an expression, but an attitude towards communal attunement. In this spring workshop in Piedicavallo, this essence will be investigated. There will be no steps to learn or techniques to memorise, but an open invitation to rediscover the body as a place of trust and relation. Through gaze, reflexes and sweat — essential traces of movement — the way singularities can meet and dialogue will be explored. An opportunity to loosen social structures and seek a connection free from prejudice.;SAT 16;ON;ALESSANDRO LONGO – REINCANTAMENTO;Digital Tools for Live Arts Event Management: Ethical Implications and Practical Applications;14:30 / 17:30;The digital platforms we use to administer cultural projects are not neutral tools: they embed economic, ecological and social choices that are often invisible. This session proposes a critical analysis of the most common tools in project design processes, highlighting their impacts and ethical implications. After a diagnostic phase, the meeting explores alternatives and more conscious practices of use through concrete examples and applied exercises.;SAB 23;ON;LORENZO CARANGELO – ARCI;Third Sector Reform: Implications for Cultural Associations and Live Arts;14:30 / 17:30;This session offers an analysis of the Third Sector Reform as a dispositif that concretely redefines the conditions of existence for cultural associations. The meeting explores how norms, monitoring and accountability affect timelines, economies and possibilities for experimentation, especially in marginal or liminal territorial contexts. Through case studies and open discussion, it provides tools to translate the reform in a situated way, between adaptation, resistance and political positioning.;;;;;;
