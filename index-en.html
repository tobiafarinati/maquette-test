          <p>Maquette is a free training programme that explores cultural project design in all its complexity,
            challenging extractive and standardised models while experimenting with alternative methods and tools. It
            takes shape as a collective process that weaves together theory and practice, online and in-person work,
            training and production.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The programme runs from February to August 2026 and combines 30 hours of online sessions with 28 hours of
            in-person meetings in Piedicavallo, Valle Cervo (BI), culminating in a final output to be presented in
            August 2026 during Piedicavallo Festival.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <p>Maquette is conceived as a space for shared learning, co-design and experimentation, curated by Sotterranea
            and Lira Transalpina with the support of the Erasmus+ European programme.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h1>The programme engages with questions related to the production and curation of live arts events, the
            history and genealogies of performance, decision-making processes and collective work practices. It also
            addresses key tools and infrastructures of contemporary cultural project design — from European funding
            calls to the Third Sector Reform, from digital administration to the energetic and relational sustainability
            of cultural labour. The pathway includes practices of accessibility, traversability and anti-ableism,
            methodologies of ecological observation and situated research, relationships with territory in marginal
            contexts and inner areas, as well as experiments in DIY setups, movement, body and listening.
          </h1>
          <br>
          <h1>At the core of the programme lies a question: how can we collectively practise sustainability within
            cultural processes, understood in its territorial, economic, institutional and political dimensions?</h1>
